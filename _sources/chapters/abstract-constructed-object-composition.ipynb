    "# Abstract constructed object composition\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Prerequisites\n",
    ":class: info\n",
    "In this chapter we’re exploring the object composition abstraction level that we refer to as \"abstract constructed object composition\". Please have a look at the chapter [object composition](object-composition:abstraction-levels) if you have not already.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "%In truth, there isn't much to say about abstract constructed object composition.\n",
    "%I would be so bold as to suggest that it is quite uncommon that we find ourselves in a position where abstract constructed object composition is a useful solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Let's think about it.\n",
    "If an object composition is constructed then that means that the composing object is the one who instantiates the composed.\n",
    "If the object composition is abstract then that means that the compile-time type of the constructed object is abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mean \"abstract\" in the sense of \"abstraction\", which means an [interface](interfaces) or an [abstract class](abstract-classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, abstract constructed object composition only makes sense if we want to use the power of subtype polymorphism within a class but don't want to let others outside choose what object or objects from that subtyping hierarchy we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be honest.\n",
    "I have a really hard time coming up with examples of this that don't also somehow include abstract injected object composition in one form or another.\n",
    "%I would be so bold as to suggest that it is quite uncommon that we find ourselves in a position where abstract constructed object composition is a very useful solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, how about a cipher that determines what cipher to use based on what cipher it thinks has been used to encode some other string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we have the following code that we've written in previous chapters."
