# How to master object-oriented programming in C#

*This is **not** about learning how to code.*

It's about learning how to **bend the world to your will**.
🌍
You are learning to touch the lives of millions, influence societies, disrupt industries, and redefine the limits of what's possible.

***We are the protagonists. 🤘 The world needs you.***

You want to **become an exceptional programmer.**
<u>I want to help you</u>.

I have spent an *astronomical* amount of time ⏱️ trying to figure out the **best order in which to learn these concepts**, without confusing jumps back and forth.

The structure? Uncomplicated.
I give you a **flat table of contents**.
All important concepts are shamelessly short, top-level chapters.

I've been teaching object-oriented programming (OOP) in C# **for a decade**. This is the book I wish I had been given.

Expect **breadth over depth**, as understanding the periphery can dramatically enhance your grasp of the core.

Whether you're a seasoned coder looking for a turbo boost 🚀 or a complete novice, this is your ticket to mastering OOP.
**No previous coding skills required**. Let me meet you where you are.

Who am I? I'm [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.christopherokhravi.com), a senior lecturer at Uppsala University with a Ph.D. 🎓 in Information Systems. You might know me from my popular [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/christopherokhravi) on programming.

Let's dive in and start building these skills one by one.



%This is a monumental day for me because you're here and it's a monumental day for you since **our lives will never be the same again**.

Want to truly understand object oriented programming?
This is a book on object oriented programming.
Learn how to write object oriented programs designed to provide as much value as possible as fast as possible without compromising future value.


We start from fundamentals and build knowledge step by step. In the end you will have a great understanding of not only object oriented programming but also many things on the way.

In this book we are not asking what a beautiful program looks like and we are not asking what a technically efficient program (in terms of space time complexity) looks like. In this book we are exploring how to write programs that provide value today while still allowing us to keep providing value in the future.

If you want to become a programmer, an architect, a designer, or a modeller of object oriented systems, then you are in the right place.

```{admonition} Video lectures
